# 🛠️ Projects

Welcome to **Projects** — a personal archive of *everything* I’ve ever built.  
From the tiniest console apps to potential future operating systems (yeah, I said it 😎).

## 🌟 What's in the Vault?

Here you'll find:
- ✅ Basic beginner-friendly projects
- 🎮 Fun experimental builds
- 💡 Creative tools
- ⚙️ Systems-level madness (maybe... an OS one day 👀)
- 🚧 Half-finished ideas (hey, it’s part of the grind!)

This is where my code grows, evolves, and occasionally breaks the universe.

## 🧰 Tech Stack (so far)

- C++ (my first love ❤️)
- Python (for chill automation vibes)
- Web stack (HTML/CSS/JS when I feel fancy)
- Assembly (when I wanna cry but learn 🔥)
- More coming as I explore...

## 🔓 Open Source Vibes

Feel free to explore, learn from, or fork anything here.  
But if you clone my OS one day... at least name it something cool 😅

---

## 📢 Wanna Collaborate?

Open a PR or hit me up with ideas — I’m always down to build cool stuff with cool people 🚀

> 🧠 Every line of code here taught me something. Some lines taught me **what not to do.** That’s growth.
